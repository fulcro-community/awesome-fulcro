= Awesome Fulcro

A curated list of awesome resources for https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro[Fulcro] and https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-rad[Fulcro RAD], the most awesome (web)app framework the Earth has ever seen.

=== Motivation

* ðŸŽ¬ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMbGhgVf9Do&t=628s[Why Build Solutions with Fulcro - Tom Toor] (video, 2019)
* https://blog.jakubholy.net/2020/talk-want-more-from-your-frontend-framework/[Want more from your frontend framework! Re-thinking web dev experience] - "`I will compare Redux + REST with a full-stack, component-centric solution based on a graph API (think GraphQL) that I came to love.`"

=== Learning

==== Recommended community resources

Check out Jakub's self-paced https://github.com/holyjak/fulcro-intro-wshop[workshop Introduction to creating webapps with Fulcro] to get familiar with the concepts and the amazing tooling before deep-diving into learning the details. Then continue with the xref:tutorial-minimalist-fulcro:index.adoc[Minimalist Fulcro Tutorial] and its exercises. For more, see the xref:guide-learning-fulcro:index.adoc[Guide to learning Fulcro] and all the other https://fulcro-community.github.io/[fulcro-community resources].

** ðŸŽ¬ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVi9lDx-4C_TBRiHfjnjXaK2J3BIUDPnf[Grokking Fulcro series] - The intended audience of this video series is anyone with a basic understanding of Javascript and Clojurescript that wishes to know more about how Fulcro works. I do not assume a ton of prior knowledge about Fulcro itself, yet I think even most seasoned Fulcro developers will learn something from every video. Focus: Explain the lower-level details of React and Fulcro in the context of Clojurescript. Help developers gain an understanding of the core APIs of Fulcro. Cover the approaches to designing common things in Fulcro so you can apply those patterns in your own applications. Reveal some of the superpowers of Clojurescript for people that do not know it well.

==== Templates and Examples

Templates

* The official https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro-template[fulcro-template] and https://github.com/holyjak/fulcro-rad-demo[fulcro-rad-demo]
* https://github.com/dvingo/dv.fulcro-template - based on the fulcro3 template but differs in backend tech and will continue to diverge as features are added to this template.
* https://github.com/holyjak/minimalist-fulcro-template-backendless[minimalist-fulcro-template-backendless] - A template for starting a new, frontend-only Fulcro application with in-browser Pathom. Intended for playing with and learning Fulcro, not for production apps, and therefore simpler than the official fulcro-template.
* https://github.com/holyjak/minimalist-fulcro-template[minimalist-fulcro-template] - similar to the one above, but with an actual backend
